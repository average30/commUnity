## ❤️ Gratitude

This project would not have been possible without the contributions of the following individuals:

- **Scott**: For leading the team and helping with development of the platform - basically, he was the GPS that may have led us astray a few times, but in the end helped us find our way!
- **Tejas**: For generating ideas, leading and developing the platform. Managing the repo and helping create the platform - he’s like a Swiss Army knife, but with fewer blades and more caffeine.
- **Joshua**: For helping to develop the platform, generating ideas, bringing positive vibes, and providing marketing expertise - he's the team's light in the dungeon, guiding us through the dark times when we were just trying to remember where we left our caffeine!
- **Elvin**: For being our lead designer, spending overnight developing graphics for our team - he's the reason our project looks good enough to put it up on the big screen.
- **Louis**: For keeping us on track when we got sidetracked, bringing us back to our senses - he’s the human equivalent of a “please stay on topic” sign, and we couldn’t have done it without him!
